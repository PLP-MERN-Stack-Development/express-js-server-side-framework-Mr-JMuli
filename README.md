##  Testing the API

You can test the API using **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or the **curl** command-line tool.

### 🔹 Using Postman

1. Open Postman and create a new request.  
2. Enter the request URL (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/api/products`).  
3. Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
4. For protected routes (POST, PUT, DELETE), go to the **Headers** tab and add:
   ```
   Key: Authorization
   Value: Bearer mysecrettoken
   ```
5. For POST and PUT requests, set the **Body** to “raw” and select “JSON” type.
6. Click **Send** and check the response.

### 🔹 Using curl

**Get all products**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products
```

**Create a product**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Vitamin C","price":250,"description":"Boosts immunity"}'
```

**Update a product**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/products/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"price":300}'
```

**Delete a product**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/products/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken"
```
